Hadoop Control README
=====================

The purpose of hadoop-control (aka: another poorly named open source project) is
to rearchitect the Hadoop core web applications around a modern MVC structure on
top of Spring MVC. Ideally, this would, at some point, be submitted back to the
ASF to be included in Hadoop proper.

Project hosting is currently at http://github.org/esammer/hadoop-control

This project is actively accepting any contributions and community support.

Build

    Hadoop Control currently uses Maven as its build system.
    
    # mvn package
    
    Should produce a reasonable working package (by the end of 0.0.1) in the
    form of a war file.

Roadmap

    0.0.1:
        - Bootstrap a skeletal UI for the Job Tracker.
        - Figure out how to, with minimal disruption, integrate with the
          existing Hadoop code base. (Possibly defer actual integration until
          the code reaches a reasonable point.)
        - Create stubs for the JobTracker, Configuration, ClusterMetics, and
          other core Hadoop objects to facilitate testing and prototyping.
        - Build community support.
